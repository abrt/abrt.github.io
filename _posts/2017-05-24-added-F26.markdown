We've recently added Fedora 26 to [retrace.fedoraproject.org](https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/).
We were unable to do that in branching time, because of insufficient disk space. This has been resolved now.
And you can report your crashes on all current Fedoras now.

Next time we will be able to add new Fedora version during branching time.
