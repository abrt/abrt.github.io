Our team realized that when users visit our [server](https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/)
to access for example [FAF](https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/faf) the first page
did not contain any useful information about ABRT and our products.

We addressed this problem and prepared a **new webpage**. It is already deployed on
our production server [https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/](https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/).

If you don't remember how looked our old page, I attached one screenshot for you.
*(note: It comes from [retrace-server](https://github.com/abrt/retrace-server) component,
which also runs on the same server)*
