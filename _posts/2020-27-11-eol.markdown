## Packages will no longer be built for EL6 and EL7

For a [long](https://github.com/abrt/faf/issues/735) [time](https://github.com/abrt/abrt/issues/1337), we talked about EOLing EL6 and EL7. What does it actually mean?

RHEL 6 is [going to be EOL](https://access.redhat.com/discussions/2399461) at the end of this month (30th November 2020). We will no longer build ABRT packages for EL6 and we will stop supporting EL6 as content.

RHEL 7 is still active but quite old. ABRT team will stop testing, building, and developing on top of RHEL7. We are going to focus on RHEL 8 and upcoming RHEL and Fedora. We still support RHEL 7 as content (e.g., in ABRT Analytics).

This is a description of the current de-facto state. The last release of ABRT Analytics was already not built for RHEL 7.

## End of reporting to Customer Portal

Red Hat Customer Portal was migrated to a new backend that does not have the API which we need and as a result, we removed reporting to Customer Portal from ABRT (libreport - to be precise).
